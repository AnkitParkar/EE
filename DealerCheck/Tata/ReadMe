The name for TataSettings.json should not be changed and it should be stored in the same directory/folder as the scripts. 
For TataSettings.json:
1. The names for the URL should not be changed. Only the URL's themselves can be updated. 
2. The URL should be to the checkout page/booking page and not the website for the car. 

To check only for specific cars, assign the value as Y instead of N. For example if you want to check for tiago, it should be
'tiago_check':'Y',
and if you do not want to check for tigor, it should be 
'tigor_check':'N',

The script to be run is MainCon.py 
For the script to run, you need to install Selenium, json, pyautogui, csv for python.

You also need to download chromedriver and extract it. The version should be the same as the chrome version on your system. 
You need to copy the absolute path of the chromedriver and paste it in the TataSettings.json file for the key 'chromedriver_path'

For EV Dealer checks, the columns are State, Dealer, Trade Name, CPM Location Name . The name of the csv has to be updated in the TataSettings.json file, 'ev_dealer_csv_name'. 
You should either store the csv file in the same directory/folder or the absolute path should be provided. 

For the rest of the cars (Tiago, Tigor, Harrier, Safari, Altroz, Altroz Imaginator, Nexon Imaginator, Punch), the columns in the dealer files are 'State ,City, Trade Name ,Dealer 
Name' . You should either store the csv file in the same directory/folder or the absolute path should be provided.
