The name for TataSettings.json should not be changed and it should be stored in the same directory/folder as the scripts. 
For TataSettings.json:
1. The names for the URL should not be changed. Only the URL's themselves can be updated. 
2. The URL should be to the checkout page/booking page and not the website for the car. 

To check only for specific cars, assign the value as Y instead of N. For example if you want to check for tiago, it should be
'tiago_check':'Y',
and if you do not want to check for tigor, it should be 
'tigor_check':'N',

The script to be run is MainCon.py
